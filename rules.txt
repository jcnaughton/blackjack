- The object is to have a hand with a total value higher than the dealer’s without going over 21. 
- Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth a value of 10. 
- An Ace has the value of 1 or 11. 
- The remaining cards are counted at face value.
- You and fellow players are dealt two cards each whilst the dealer is dealt one face up. 
- If your first 2 cards add up to 21 (an Ace and a card valued 10), that’s Blackjack!
- Once all players have taken their turn the dealer draws another card for their hand. 
- The dealer must draw until they reach 17 or more.
- Once all cards are drawn, whoever has a total closer to 21 than the dealer wins. 
- If player’s hand and dealer’s hand have an equal value, it’s a tie.
